# AeonLabs Smart PCB for Home Wellbeing Assessment
This repo contains the KiCad files for the Smart PCB for Home well-being assessment. Easy installation on any home or office glass window frame or a building wall. This PCB is mainly intended to do LIVE monitoring of Bio copatible electromagnetic energy detection (Bio EMF)  for biopotential measurements and data assessment of indoor wellbeing quality.  

The PCB uses a ESP32-S3 packed with Bluetooth, BLE and WiFi ready to be programmed for Home Assistant.  

Functionalities available: 

* Temperature;
* Humidity;
* Motion sensor;
* CO2, NOx sensor;
* Light intensity sensor;
* RGB LED;
* Magnetic Buzzer;
* **Bio copatible electromagnetic energy detection (Bio EMF) on glass windows at home or office** for biopotential measurements

## Bio copatible electromagnetic energy detection (Bio EMF) on glass windows at home or office
This PCB uses the AD8232 IC to detect electromagnetic energy in particular in the rage of bio frequencies a human body (and life) operates. The AD8232 is an integrated signal conditioning block for ECG and other biopotential measurement applications. It is designed to extract, amplify, and filter small biopotential signals in the presence of noisy conditions, such as those created by motion or remote electrode placement. The AD8232 uses a three electrode interface and implements a two pole high pass filter with a cutoff at 0.3 Hz, and a two-pole low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 37 Hz. The total signal gain in the pass band is 400.

## Application on Glass windows at a home or Office
This PCB is intended to be installed into a window frame and powered by a solar tile and small battery. 
The glass window where this smart device is going to be installed needs to have a conductive coating (any) able to conduct electricity. typical instalations include a ITO conducting flim or DIY manual deposition of a Indium Tin Oxide coating directy into the surface of a window glass. For more information about this kind of coating see:
- [Indium–tin oxide coatings via chemical solution deposition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040609001010355)
- [3D indium tin oxide electrodes by ultrasonic spray deposition for current collection applications](https://documentserver.uhasselt.be/bitstream/1942/24191/2/3D%20ITO.pdf)

## Aplication at side walls (interior and exterior)
This PCB is intended to be instaled into any side wall of a building and powered by a solar tile and small battery. The buidling wall where this smart device is going to be installed needs to have a conductive coating (any) able to conduct electricity.
